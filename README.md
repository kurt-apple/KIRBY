# KIRBY
![alt text](https://github.com/kurt-apple/KIRBY/blob/master/ICON/kirby.ico "Kirby to the rescue!")   
KIRBY is a batch (yup) file that eats distracting and off-topic programs and websites once customized.
- ICACLS for program access permissions for current user
- updates from stevenblack's hosts-file repo
- option to make sure your own list gets appended to the stevenblack file that gets downloaded.
- can make sounds using VLC!

See the batch file for more info. Enjoy!
